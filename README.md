In this project, we have developed a deep learning project that can distinguish urban sounds using the [Urban Sounds Dataset](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html). 

[Global AI Hub](https://globalaihub.com/) presented us with the already converted version of the sounds in this dataset into spectrograms. Spectograms can be reached via this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xey3vAVNDjWxnSfhuUsf_5dGANZWmCog)
